      "FUNCTION: Key component in the assembly and functioning of vertebrate striated muscles. By providing connections at the level of individual microfilaments, it contributes to the fine balance of forces between the two halves of the sarcomere. The size and extensibility of the cross-links are the main determinants of sarcomere extensibility properties of muscle. In non-muscle cells, seems to play a role in chromosome condensation and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Might link the lamina network to chromatin or nuclear actin, or both during interphase. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:9804419}."

      "DISEASE: Cardiomyopathy, familial hypertrophic 9 (CMH9) [MIM:613765]: A hereditary heart disorder characterized by ventricular hypertrophy, which is usually asymmetric and often involves the interventricular septum. The symptoms include dyspnea, syncope, collapse, palpitations, and chest pain. They can be readily provoked by exercise. The disorder has inter- and intrafamilial variability ranging from benign to malignant forms with high risk of cardiac failure and sudden cardiac death. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:10462489}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry.",

Muscle weakness and atrophy are usually confined to the anterior compartment of the lower leg, in particular the tibialis anterior muscle. Clinical symptoms usually occur at age 35-45 years or much later. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:12145747, ECO:0000269|PubMed:12891679}.

Skeletal muscle biopsies show minicore-like lesions with mitochondrial depletion and sarcomere disorganization, centralized nuclei, and type 1 fiber predominance. Dystrophic changes become apparent in the second decade. Cardiac muscle biopsies show disruption of myocardial architecture, nuclear hypertrophy, and endomysial fibrosis. Sudden death may occurr due to cardiomyopathy. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17444505}. Note=The disease is caused by mutations affecting the gene represented in this entry."

    "summary": "This gene encodes a large abundant protein of striated muscle. The product of this gene is divided into two regions, a N-terminal I-band and a C-terminal A-band. The I-band, which is the elastic part of the molecule, contains two regions of tandem immunoglobulin domains on either side of a PEVK region that is rich in proline, glutamate, valine and lysine. The A-band, which is thought to act as a protein-ruler, contains a mixture of immunoglobulin and fibronectin repeats, and possesses kinase activity. An N-terminal Z-disc region and a C-terminal M-line region bind to the Z-line and M-line of the sarcomere, respectively, so that a single titin molecule spans half the length of a sarcomere. Titin also contains binding sites for muscle associated proteins so it serves as an adhesion template for the assembly of contractile machinery in muscle cells. It has also been identified as a structural protein for chromosomes. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. Considerable variability exists in the I-band, the M-line and the Z-disc regions of titin. Variability in the I-band region contributes to the differences in elasticity of different titin isoforms and, therefore, to the differences in elasticity of different muscle types. Mutations in this gene are associated with familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 9, and autoantibodies to titin are produced in patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma.
