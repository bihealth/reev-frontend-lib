    # Welcome to the REEV Frontend Lib Storybook

    This storybook contains the reuseable components of the `reev-frontend-lib` package.
    Generally, all components will "only" display information retrieved from the backend services.
    The components might allow for some interactivity, e.g., sorting or filtering, but that is mostly done in the frontend code.
